-- TODO --

- come up with a solution to the language selector image. currently it uses an npm package, but github can't use those.

- add functionality to buttons etc.

- in the footer make it so you cant select the whole element for email, linkedin and github (currently these link elements have a width of 100%, so make them narrower)
